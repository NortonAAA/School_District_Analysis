# School_District_Analysis
MSU Boot Camp Module 4

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to produce analysis and visualization of summary statistics by school, school type, and spending on students. This is the updated analysis based on the need to remove the impact of academic dishonesty in the numbers.
## Results of the Analysis
We will break the results of this analysis into several sections that focus on the overall impact of this data removal of Thomas High School 9th Grades replaced with overall.
1) District Results
2) School Summary Results
3) Updated School Performance Compared to Peers
### District Results
With the updated results we can see a slight negative change in the Averages and % Passing for each category. The % of overall passing having the most movement due to the combination of % Passing Math and % Passing Reading both having moved down.

### School Summary Results
Thomas High School was lowered in several categories but remained in an approximate 90% Overall Passing level. This moved them from the top spot compared to all the schools to the second position. This indicates an overall opportunity to improve the 9th graders but not so significant as if we had counted the 9th graders as 0 and really not much of a need for the dishonesty.

### Math Scores and Reading Scores by Grade
Below we can see the comparisons for both the Math and Reading scores before and after the removal of the 9th grade as confirmation.

### Impact to Groups by School Spending, Size, and Type
For the rest of the analysis, we show the comparison of analysis between Scores by school spending, by school size, and by school type. All these categories were unaffected by the removal of Thomas High School's 9th grades as their 461 students did not contribute as much to the larger aggregate of the district.

## Summary
To summarize the impact of the updated analysis, Thomas High School ultimately wasn't drastically impacted from a top school but went from the best school in the district in % Overall Passing to 2nd. Removal of those scores additionally did lower the % Overall Passing, Average Math Score, Average Reading Scores. It is important note that continued look out for academic dishonesty is necessary as the difference between schools is really close.
